           The intersection of art and data science has gained more popularity in recent years. The applications between art and AI serve as inspiration for people to produce new works of art that can be more accessible to the broader audience.

            In the fashion industry there is constant demand for new and interesting design patterns, which can often be expensive and time consuming to create. Fashion designers are bound by their own internal biases and face limitations on the level of creativity and in-demand fashion that they can create within a given timeframe.

            With advances in deep learning, neural networks can be used to alleviate some problems in this field by improving the level of creativity in design for both quantity and quality outputs. In this work, we implement a neural network model to generate new textile patterns for many fashion items. Our solutions and findings could be easily used by the non-tech savvy and will make designs more accessible for the broader audience.

                Our core architecture design includes two main components: Fabric Pattern Generator (component 1) and Segmentation & Masking (component 2).

                    In component 1, we apply the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) by training with various textile pattern datasets. The output of this component 1 will be a neural network generated image input for component 2. In component 2, another pre-trained neural network model will perform image segmentation of clothing patterns and mask the new pattern over the fashion items to produce a result.

                    In this project, we use PyTorch to build models and Django to develop website. The final product is hosted on Amazon AWS

                <p>DCGAN Model is the architecture being used for fabric pattern generation in this project. The advantage of DCGAN is its continuous improvement between the Generator and Discriminator Networks by improving the performance while reducing the loss of both networks to produce the best fake images. Below is the neural network structure of the Generator Network and Discriminator Network.

            <p>Among the eleven categories of patterns, we achieved best results â€“ where the fake images generated from the neural network were closer to the real images - with floral, cheetah, paisley, and leaves. The take-away from the result is that DCGAN model works well for the type of images that does not possess a strict geometric pattern.

                            The other interesting observation is that we can improve the model by training with various settings. This will reduce the loss performance between Generator Network and Discriminator Network :

            <p>One of the limitations we experienced is that computer vision requires computing power â€“ especially GPU â€“ in order to train the neural networks. We gained better results with larger training epochs but it was very time consuming..

            Second limitation is the limit on free available GPU resources from Google Colab we have.

            Third limitation is the accuracy of result from component 2 based on various factors: image characteristic (transparency of the background, plain icon), and blend image with people from obscure view.
