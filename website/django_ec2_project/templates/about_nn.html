            Art and data science, the two fields gain more traction in recent years. The application between ART and AI are the inspiration for people to produce new pieces of art with more accessible to the broader audience.

            In the fashion industry there is a constant demand for new and interesting design patterns, which can often be expensive and time consuming to create. Fashion designers are bound by their own internal biases and have limitations on the level of creativity and in-demand fashion that they can create within a given timeframe.

            With advance in deep learning, neural networks can be used to alleviate some problems in this field by improving the level of creative in design for both quantity and quality outputs. In this works, we implement the neural network model to generate new textile pattern for many fashion items. Our solutions and findings could be easily used by non-tech savvy and will make design creation more accessible for the broader audience.

                Our core architecture design includes two main components: Fabric Pattern Generator (component 1) and
                    Segmentation & Masking (component 2).

                In component 1, we apply the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) by training with various
                    textile pattern datasets: cartoon, checkered, cheetah, polka dots, floral, leaves, stripes and zig zag.
                    The output of this
                    component 1 will be a neural network generated image input for component 2. In the component 2, another
                    pre-trained neural network model to perform image segmentation of clothe pattern and masking the new
                    pattern over the fashion items to produce a result.

            <p>Among the categories, we achieve best results â€“ where the fake images generated from the neural network
                are closer to the real images - with floral, cheetah, paisley, and leaves. The checkered and dotted are
                showing some improvements in the fake images but still not the optimum outcome. The take-away from the
                result is that DCGAN model works well for the type of images that does not possess a strict geometric
                pattern.

                The other interesting observation that we see that can improve the model by training with various settings.
                    This will reduce the loss performance between Generator Network and Discriminator Network :
                A small Adam optimizer value (< 0.05)
                Smaller size of z latent vector ( < 100)
                Learning rate between 0.0002 and 0.00002
                The higher training epoch, the better result it yield.
                </br>
                </br>
                Art image can be viewed as an abstract art. This is due to the nature of there is no boundary of how art
                image is produced and perceived by viewer. Art can have bias as well. A regular viewer may not find the
                Picasso painting interesting, but a real artist can see the abstract inner beauty of that piece of art.
                This characteristic is also applied in the neural network generated image.</p>

            <p>One of the limitations we experience is the nature of computer vision. This area in deep learning
                requires computing power â€“ especially GPU â€“ in order to train the neural network model. The better
                result we gain but it costs lot of time to train.
                Second limitation is the limit of free available GPU resources from Google Colab we have.
                Third limitation is the accuracy of result from component 2 based on various factors: image
                characteristic (transparency background, plain icon), blend image with people from obscure view.</p>
