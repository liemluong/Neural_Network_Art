            We consider two popular deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Ultimately, we decided to use PyTorch for our project given several considerations. Briefly, PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that was developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab (FAIR) in 2016. It is an open source library for the Python programming language used to develop deep learning applications in computer vision and natural language processing. PyTorch has grown in popularity for its simplicity, ease of use, efficient memory usage, and flexibility. One of the main reasons we chose to use this library over TensorFlow is that it is integrated well with the Python language whereas TensorFlow is less of a pythonic framework and more of a new language. Additionally, performance in PyTorch is optimized automatically via parallelism where the intensive computational work during the training process is distributed among multiple CPU or GPU cores.

            For our minimum value product, we plan to develop a supervised deep learning model that produces a unique and interesting pattern.  If time permits, another aspect of our “nice to have” features include a model that will generate different and unique sewing patterns.

            We intend on building a website as a “nice to have” feature. Upon completion of our model, should time allow, we will create a website that will allow users to interact with it. The first stage of this website will focus on pattern generation. We will allow users to customize their design preferences (e.g. stripes, florals) and output a pattern based on their inputs. They will be able to download the pattern as an image file to their own devices, and use it as they wish. Further “nice to have” features on our website will include visualizing the patterns on some items or on AI generated sewing patterns - given we are able to complete this model.
